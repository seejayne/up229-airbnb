I have implemented all I have learned over the years of traveling into hosting. 

My favorite destinations are Spain, Greece and China. 

A few things I like to do during my spare time are hiking, surfing, snowboarding and playing soccer.

** Here's what people are saying about my places ** 

""Dary's home is the perfect location. Our host was really nice and the house was cozy and welcoming. Just minutes from the beach and Venice nightlife""
~ Zachary ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Darys place was exactly as described! It is a quaint, comfortable place to call home while exploring Venice and the surrounding areas. While there are a few units, you would barely know there is anyone else there. There are lots of nice coffee shops and resteraunts very close by and the beach is a fifteen minute stroll away! Dary was very responsive and helpful!!""
~ Mark ~ 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""This place is amazing! Loved everything about it. :)""
~ Cortney ~

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Probably my favourite Air BnB in Venice. So convenient. So cool and clean. Unique place with a truly caring and considerate host in Dary. Will 100% stay there again. ""

~ Christopher ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay in Dary's cottage. It was on a nice, quiet street, yet close to many luxuries. Being into health, having WholeFoods near by was a bonus. We loved being able to cook breakfast and have little meals at the cottage, or go to whole foods for fresh, organic meals. The place was so cozy and Dary is excellent at making a small space feel big and comfortable. This place has everything! Great stay and very affordable. Dary greeted us upon our arrival and made us feel welcome. It's a safe space and very peaceful. You're just moments away from the Venice Beach, great shopping, Gold's Gym, Santa Monica, and much more. When we come back, we plan on booking with Dary again! ”

“I stayed in this lovely place for several weeks and loved every minute of it. Upon my arrival I found all kinds of surprise goodies which was so generous of Dary. Whenever I had a question or issue, Dary was right there. In addition to an attentive host, i loved the cottage's location - it is safe, private, beautiful, and central to everything. The bed is large and comfortable. The kitchen has all the basics. And the big window is fabulous for light and fresh air. As a bonus, Superba is right around the corner - truly one of LA's best choice for breakfast (pastries and lattes to die for), lunch or dinner. Everyone I met at Dary's was so friendly and interesting. Really, I could not ask for more. This is a great AIRBNB!!! ”

“Dary was a fantastic host. The residence is beautiful and very relaxing. The living space was very cozy. The decor was warm and inviting with an extremely comfortable bed. It was convenient to have a kitchen space with so many cooking basics. The bathroom was very clean and stocked with essentials. It was cold while I was staying but there was a heater and the lofted bed area stayed warm all night. I had an easy time getting to the beach, Hollywood and downtown L.A.. There was always plenty of free parking in front of the home. The little extras Dary provide made the experience exceptional. I highly recommend staying here if you have a chance.”

“This place was adorable. Everything was easy & Dary was very attentive with my questions and with communication. Everything was clean and cozy and I felt safe and happy being there. This is perfect for 1-2 people who want to stay in Venice, yet be close to 101 to hit up Marina Del Rey or Santa Monica too. (Quickly) There was outside space to use if needed and extra supplies in the room if you forgot anything. All of the instructions for TV/Internet etc were very easy to understand. I appreciate a nice, clean place to lay my head at night and this was the best experience I've had at an Airbnb location so far! Thanks Dary! I will stay again next time I am in town!”    - Dana - 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Dary was communicative, friendly and an overall great host. The location was great and the apartment was on the back of the house so felt very private even though there were other units close by. I would definitely recommend staying here! The unit was so well done, clean and cosy. we loved it! thanks for being a great host. ”    - Martha -

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“We absolutely loved our stay. We are driving the coast for our honeymoon and after the wedding madness needed a cozy place to stay. We immediately felt at home in this adorable yard and room. Especially loved brewing a pot of coffee and having a slow morning in this quiet adorable place. Thanks Dary!”
~ Meghan ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“This is the second time I have stayed with Dary. The location of her rentals in proximity of the beach is FANTASTIC! Abbot Kinney street (with great restaurants and shops) is a close walk away and leads right down to the beach. She makes your stay hassle free by having everything you need and making access to the flat a breeze. Parking is also not an issue if you have a vehicle; there's plenty of free street parking. I would stay with Dary again anytime... and probably will in the future! ”
~ Ondrea ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Dary's place is absolutely adorable. Secluded, spacious with all the amenities needed. What a gem! ”
~ Jessica ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Perfect place for two! This apartment had everything you could need, from minor toiletries to snacks, laundry, cable and wi-fi. A bunch of awesome bicycles and boogie boards were available to use as well as outdoor seating areas and a firepit. The loft was very comfortable and very clean. It was nicely decorated and the entire property was so charming. Dary is an excellent host, and we felt right at home. We look forward to being a repeat visitor and we plan on sending any friends in the area her way too! ”
~Sharon~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“With Dary´s place I found my perfect place for visiting LA. I will come back for sure! The place is exactly as shown in the pictures. Everthing works and it is all clean. What you cannot see is that the cottage is located in a very nice neighborhood. It is quite, but you are still in the middle of everything. Dary is a wonderful host. She is very friendly, supportive, helpful and always available. ”

I'm Jane, your host!  I'm also mom (to Piper), girlfriend (to Brian), west coast director (for NY Magazine), and a sometime interior designer (mostly for friends).

I love my family and my work, traveling (especially when it involves great hotels!), and hitting a good yoga or spin class (I'm kinda lying about the last thing).  I am easy-going, friendly, and have a good sense of humor (all survival traits developed in childhood as the youngest of 8 kids!).  I was born in Michigan, but raised in California.  I was once left at a gas station on a family camping trip to the Grand Canyon.  I love music of all kinds...and my iPod playlist has everything from Ryan (URL HIDDEN) The (URL HIDDEN) Eminem.

Greetings! My name is Alexander, and if fate has it, I hope to be able to share a taste of why people travel from all over the world to Los Angeles, and choose Topanga Canyon as their place to land.   

keep it simple … and above all... keep it real. 

I love supporting causes I believe in and living life to its fullest.  I believe every moment an opportunity to seize our destiny and happiness.  If I had to choose a religion... it would be love. 

Im passionate about finding new and fun creative ways of generating abundance while making a positive difference.  

I’d consider myself an entrepreneur and most of my financial success has been  in Festival/Event Production, Classic Car Restoration and Sales, Management of Cannabis stores and brands and ofcourse landscape design and horticulture which hopefully you will get a chance to see if you come and visit my little slice of heaven. 

I spend most of my free time writing music/poetry, traveling,  gardening and  hunting for treasures.   

I hold integrity, love, compassion and being of service to others as key values that I strive to apply to every moment and situation.

I am grateful for everything that this life and my creator has blessed me with, including the honor of being the guardian of this sacred and special property. It has a way of calling in magical kin and like hearted beings who are seeking respite and a place to let the creative juices flow! 

My favorite place's to travel to are Bali,, Costa Rica, Tulum, Corsica, Hana/Kauai  and France.

I am a writer, an artist, and a creative expressionist of many forms.

Once upon a Time 
Within a rhyme, 
There rested a place, 
A Space and Time,
Where in a space of Void
All Is To Be…
The Expression that is You…
And the Expression that is Me…

In the Emptiness and Void,
In its Darkness and Whole…
We gave birth to a Light 
That has now lost control.
Shifting and growing 
and glowing so bright,
spark of Infinity 
in the Infinite Night.

Growing and Glowing,
Expanding with Knowing
Breathing and Living
Moving and Flowing,
Silent and Still,
Eternal and Whole,
Infinitely Empty, and Eternally Full.

As you Grow in your Light, in this Infinite Night,
Shining so radiantly White and so Bright,
Your Mother, the Darkness, the Earth and her Womb, 
Has Offered her Emptiness as your Life and your Tomb,
The Gift of this Life and the Gift of our Death.
The Contraction and Expansion of Breath.

And in the Gift of Challenge,
Times I thought to much to bear,
I discovered there was a Gift, 
that which I would like to Share,
For it is the gift of becoming strong 
And cultivating Gifts for you to Give,
Empowering you to heal others,
As you are Blessed in how you Live.

Grounded in your Presence,
Connected and Divinely Aware.
Of the stories that we Create,
Within the Stories that we Bear…
Guided by our Hearts,
Our Minds become the Tool,
to Uncover and Discover 
Limitless Jewels...
Within and all around Us.

May you always remember to live without fear.
For our physical Death will always be near.
May this be the Gift that allows you to see...
The Present of the Moment, that is You, and is Me.
And in the Presence of this Moment, 
Please know I took the Time, 
to share with you this rhyme, 
because I Love You…

It is Fear that Separates us and makes Life hard to live,
You must always remember to Love and to Give, 
to forgive and to love, for there’s so much Love… 
and this is why, the reason at hand, 
that I share with You this Gift that's so grand.
To do what you Love, To Be True to You,
To do things that honor You,
In all that You Do!

To give is to Live 
is to Love 
is to Be….
So abundantly full and yet so empty and free…
To love… 
this is to live… 
and so I love you.

The Wish I Wish to Give You is the Gift of Love for You….
Please forgive me…I forgive you . Thank You....I love you.

Born in Buenos Aires, raised in the United Kingdom, and, for 41 years a resident of California. Proud citizen of the United States, Los Angeles has been the home in which she raised her three sons. In addition to raising her family, for many years she worked as a school teacher. Now that all three of our sons are back in the Golden State, California is definitely home. These days retired from teaching, she loves to give hospitality. Living in one of the great cross road cities of the world, she has entertained people from everywhere, and expects that Airbnb will bolster that tradition.

The list goes on and on. Our family has grown and spread, but after a period of more than 20 years, all three of our sons now once again live in California, making the Golden State most definitely home!!

** Here's what people are saying about my places ** 

""Dary's home is the perfect location. Our host was really nice and the house was cozy and welcoming. Just minutes from the beach and Venice nightlife""
~ Zachary ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Darys place was exactly as described! It is a quaint, comfortable place to call home while exploring Venice and the surrounding areas. While there are a few units, you would barely know there is anyone else there. There are lots of nice coffee shops and resteraunts very close by and the beach is a fifteen minute stroll away! Dary was very responsive and helpful!!""
~ Mark ~ 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""This place is amazing! Loved everything about it. :)""
~ Cortney ~

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Probably my favourite Air BnB in Venice. So convenient. So cool and clean. Unique place with a truly caring and considerate host in Dary. Will 100% stay there again. ""

~ Christopher ~
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay in Dary's cottage. It was on a nice, quiet street, yet close to many luxuries. Being into health, having WholeFoods near by was a bonus. We loved being able to cook breakfast and have little meals at the cottage, or go to whole foods for fresh, organic meals. The place was so cozy and Dary is excellent at making a small space feel big and comfortable. This place has everything! Great stay and very affordable. Dary greeted us upon our arrival and made us feel welcome. It's a safe space and very peaceful. You're just moments away from the Venice Beach, great shopping, Gold's Gym, Santa Monica, and much more. When we come back, we plan on booking with Dary again! ”

“I stayed in this lovely place for several weeks and loved every minute of it. Upon my arrival I found all kinds of surprise goodies which was so generous of Dary. Whenever I had a question or issue, Dary was right there. In addition to an attentive host, i loved the cottage's location - it is safe, private, beautiful, and central to everything. The bed is large and comfortable. The kitchen has all the basics. And the big window is fabulous for light and fresh air. As a bonus, Superba is right around the corner - truly one of LA's best choice for breakfast (pastries and lattes to die for), lunch or dinner. Everyone I met at Dary's was so friendly and interesting. Really, I could not ask for more. This is a great AIRBNB!!! ”

“Dary was a fantastic host. The residence is beautiful and very relaxing. The living space was very cozy. The decor was warm and inviting with an extremely comfortable bed. It was convenient to have a kitchen space with so many cooking basics. The bathroom was very clean and stocked with essentials. It was cold while I was staying but there was a heater and the lofted bed area stayed warm all night. I had an easy time getting to the beach, Hollywood and downtown L.A.. There was always plenty of free parking in front of the home. The little extras Dary provide made the experience exceptional. I highly recommend staying here if you have a chance.”

“This place was adorable. Everything was easy & Dary was very attentive with my questions and with communication. Everything was clean and cozy and I felt safe and happy being there. This is perfect for 1-2 people who want to stay in Venice, yet be close to 101 to hit up Marina Del Rey or Santa Monica too. (Quickly) There was outside space to use if needed and extra supplies in the room if you forgot anything. All of the instructions for TV/Internet etc were very easy to understand. I appreciate a nice, clean place to lay my head at night and this was the best experience I've had at an Airbnb location so far! Thanks Dary! I will stay again next time I am in town!”    - Dana - 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Dary was communicative, friendly and an overall great host. The location was great and the apartment was on the back of the house so felt very private even though there were other units close by. I would definitely recommend staying here! The unit was so well done, clean and cosy. we loved it! thanks for being a great host. ”    - Martha -

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“We absolutely loved our stay. We are driving the coast for our honeymoon and after the wedding madness needed a cozy place to stay. We immediately felt at home in this adorable yard and room. Especially loved brewing a pot of coffee and having a slow morning in this quiet adorable place. Thanks Dary!”
~ Meghan ~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“This is the second time I have stayed with Dary. The location of her rentals in proximity of the beach is FANTASTIC! Abbot Kinney street (with great restaurants and shops) is a close walk away and leads right down to the beach. She makes your stay hassle free by having everything you need and making access to the flat a breeze. Parking is also not an issue if you have a vehicle; there's plenty of free street parking. I would stay with Dary again anytime... and probably will in the future! ”

“Dary's place is absolutely adorable. Secluded, spacious with all the amenities needed. What a gem! ”

“Perfect place for two! This apartment had everything you could need, from minor toiletries to snacks, laundry, cable and wi-fi. A bunch of awesome bicycles and boogie boards were available to use as well as outdoor seating areas and a firepit. The loft was very comfortable and very clean. It was nicely decorated and the entire property was so charming. Dary is an excellent host, and we felt right at home. We look forward to being a repeat visitor and we plan on sending any friends in the area her way too! ”

“With Dary´s place I found my perfect place for visiting LA. I will come back for sure! The place is exactly as shown in the pictures. Everthing works and it is all clean. What you cannot see is that the cottage is located in a very nice neighborhood. It is quite, but you are still in the middle of everything. Dary is a wonderful host. She is very friendly, supportive, helpful and always available. ”

""Dary's home is the perfect location. Our host was really nice and the house was cozy and welcoming. Just minutes from the beach and Venice nightlife""
~ Zachary ~

""Darys place was exactly as described! It is a quaint, comfortable place to call home while exploring Venice and the surrounding areas. While there are a few units, you would barely know there is anyone else there. There are lots of nice coffee shops and resteraunts very close by and the beach is a fifteen minute stroll away! Dary was very responsive and helpful!!""

""This place is amazing! Loved everything about it. :)""

""Probably my favourite Air BnB in Venice. So convenient. So cool and clean. Unique place with a truly caring and considerate host in Dary. Will 100% stay there again. ""

~ Christopher ~

“My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay in Dary's cottage. It was on a nice, quiet street, yet close to many luxuries. Being into health, having WholeFoods near by was a bonus. We loved being able to cook breakfast and have little meals at the cottage, or go to whole foods for fresh, organic meals. The place was so cozy and Dary is excellent at making a small space feel big and comfortable. This place has everything! Great stay and very affordable. Dary greeted us upon our arrival and made us feel welcome. It's a safe space and very peaceful. You're just moments away from the Venice Beach, great shopping, Gold's Gym, Santa Monica, and much more. When we come back, we plan on booking with Dary again! ”

“I stayed in this lovely place for several weeks and loved every minute of it. Upon my arrival I found all kinds of surprise goodies which was so generous of Dary. Whenever I had a question or issue, Dary was right there. In addition to an attentive host, i loved the cottage's location - it is safe, private, beautiful, and central to everything. The bed is large and comfortable. The kitchen has all the basics. And the big window is fabulous for light and fresh air. As a bonus, Superba is right around the corner - truly one of LA's best choice for breakfast (pastries and lattes to die for), lunch or dinner. Everyone I met at Dary's was so friendly and interesting. Really, I could not ask for more. This is a great AIRBNB!!! ”

“Dary was a fantastic host. The residence is beautiful and very relaxing. The living space was very cozy. The decor was warm and inviting with an extremely comfortable bed. It was convenient to have a kitchen space with so many cooking basics. The bathroom was very clean and stocked with essentials. It was cold while I was staying but there was a heater and the lofted bed area stayed warm all night. I had an easy time getting to the beach, Hollywood and downtown L.A.. There was always plenty of free parking in front of the home. The little extras Dary provide made the experience exceptional. I highly recommend staying here if you have a chance.”

“This place was adorable. Everything was easy & Dary was very attentive with my questions and with communication. Everything was clean and cozy and I felt safe and happy being there. This is perfect for 1-2 people who want to stay in Venice, yet be close to 101 to hit up Marina Del Rey or Santa Monica too. (Quickly) There was outside space to use if needed and extra supplies in the room if you forgot anything. All of the instructions for TV/Internet etc were very easy to understand. I appreciate a nice, clean place to lay my head at night and this was the best experience I've had at an Airbnb location so far! Thanks Dary! I will stay again next time I am in town!”    - Dana -

“Dary was communicative, friendly and an overall great host. The location was great and the apartment was on the back of the house so felt very private even though there were other units close by. I would definitely recommend staying here! The unit was so well done, clean and cosy. we loved it! thanks for being a great host. ”    - Martha -

“We absolutely loved our stay. We are driving the coast for our honeymoon and after the wedding madness needed a cozy place to stay. We immediately felt at home in this adorable yard and room. Especially loved brewing a pot of coffee and having a slow morning in this quiet adorable place. Thanks Dary!”

“This is the second time I have stayed with Dary. The location of her rentals in proximity of the beach is FANTASTIC! Abbot Kinney street (with great restaurants and shops) is a close walk away and leads right down to the beach. She makes your stay hassle free by having everything you need and making access to the flat a breeze. Parking is also not an issue if you have a vehicle; there's plenty of free street parking. I would stay with Dary again anytime... and probably will in the future! ”

“Perfect place for two! This apartment had everything you could need, from minor toiletries to snacks, laundry, cable and wi-fi. A bunch of awesome bicycles and boogie boards were available to use as well as outdoor seating areas and a firepit. The loft was very comfortable and very clean. It was nicely decorated and the entire property was so charming. Dary is an excellent host, and we felt right at home. We look forward to being a repeat visitor and we plan on sending any friends in the area her way too! ”

“With Dary´s place I found my perfect place for visiting LA. I will come back for sure! The place is exactly as shown in the pictures. Everthing works and it is all clean. What you cannot see is that the cottage is located in a very nice neighborhood. It is quite, but you are still in the middle of everything. Dary is a wonderful host. She is very friendly, supportive, helpful and always available. ”

Greetings! My name is Alexander, and if fate has it, I hope to be able to share a taste of why people travel from all over the world to Los Angeles, and choose Topanga Canyon as their place to land.   

keep it simple … and above all... keep it real. 

I love supporting causes I believe in and living life to its fullest.  I believe every moment an opportunity to seize our destiny and happiness.  If I had to choose a religion... it would be love. 

Im passionate about finding new and fun creative ways of generating abundance while making a positive difference.  

I’d consider myself an entrepreneur and most of my financial success has been  in Festival/Event Production, Classic Car Restoration and Sales, Management of Cannabis stores and brands and ofcourse landscape design and horticulture which hopefully you will get a chance to see if you come and visit my little slice of heaven. 

I spend most of my free time writing music/poetry, traveling,  gardening and  hunting for treasures.   

I hold integrity, love, compassion and being of service to others as key values that I strive to apply to every moment and situation.

I am grateful for everything that this life and my creator has blessed me with, including the honor of being the guardian of this sacred and special property. It has a way of calling in magical kin and like hearted beings who are seeking respite and a place to let the creative juices flow! 

My favorite place's to travel to are Bali,, Costa Rica, Tulum, Corsica, Hana/Kauai  and France.

Once upon a Time 
Within a rhyme, 
There rested a place, 
A Space and Time,
Where in a space of Void
All Is To Be…
The Expression that is You…
And the Expression that is Me…

In the Emptiness and Void,
In its Darkness and Whole…
We gave birth to a Light 
That has now lost control.
Shifting and growing 
and glowing so bright,
spark of Infinity 
in the Infinite Night.

Growing and Glowing,
Expanding with Knowing
Breathing and Living
Moving and Flowing,
Silent and Still,
Eternal and Whole,
Infinitely Empty, and Eternally Full.

As you Grow in your Light, in this Infinite Night,
Shining so radiantly White and so Bright,
Your Mother, the Darkness, the Earth and her Womb, 
Has Offered her Emptiness as your Life and your Tomb,
The Gift of this Life and the Gift of our Death.
The Contraction and Expansion of Breath.

And in the Gift of Challenge,
Times I thought to much to bear,
I discovered there was a Gift, 
that which I would like to Share,
For it is the gift of becoming strong 
And cultivating Gifts for you to Give,
Empowering you to heal others,
As you are Blessed in how you Live.

Grounded in your Presence,
Connected and Divinely Aware.
Of the stories that we Create,
Within the Stories that we Bear…
Guided by our Hearts,
Our Minds become the Tool,
to Uncover and Discover 
Limitless Jewels...
Within and all around Us.

May you always remember to live without fear.
For our physical Death will always be near.
May this be the Gift that allows you to see...
The Present of the Moment, that is You, and is Me.
And in the Presence of this Moment, 
Please know I took the Time, 
to share with you this rhyme, 
because I Love You…

It is Fear that Separates us and makes Life hard to live,
You must always remember to Love and to Give, 
to forgive and to love, for there’s so much Love… 
and this is why, the reason at hand, 
that I share with You this Gift that's so grand.
To do what you Love, To Be True to You,
To do things that honor You,
In all that You Do!

To give is to Live 
is to Love 
is to Be….
So abundantly full and yet so empty and free…
To love… 
this is to live… 
and so I love you.

The Wish I Wish to Give You is the Gift of Love for You….
Please forgive me…I forgive you . Thank You....I love you.

I grew up between the Mountains of Colorado, in Vail and Aspen, and a large cattle ranch in Northwest Montana.  After a year of school at Prescott College in Arizona and several more shooting ski films in Colorado, I moved to North Hollywood where I lasted about 6 months before fleeing to Half Moon Bay.  I eventually made it back to Hollywood because of ""The Business"" and for about 5 years lived on my sailboat.  Throughout this time I was traveling the world shooting films and first kayak descents of rivers and ski descents of mountains.  About 10 years ago I met my sweetheart at the Premier of an IMAX Film called ""Mystery of the Nile"" we shot while making the first ""Source to Sea"" descent of the Nile.  After a couple of years living in the Marina we decided to settle in Topanga with our young family.  As luck would have it, we found a magical piece of property, with direct access to over 100 miles of hiking/mountain biking trails through Topanga State Park and adjacent wild areas, while being only 22 miles direct from downtown Los Angeles.  Now I am able to work closer to home and family.  Airbnb along with some beautiful property with stunning views is helping fulfill that dream....

I recently wrote the Malibu-Topanga Guidebook,  which will be available on Amazon for auto-format viewing on many venues including cell phones, iPads, Tablets, Ebook Readers, Laptops, PCs and Smart TVs. I also completed a book on fiction set in Mallorca, Spain and spanning a time line from WWII through the cold war of the early sixties. It is called the Island of Salt ad Tears. The book just came back from editing, which I am hard pressed to plow through.  In addition, I just completely revised a law book on tenant's rights that I wrote over twenty years ago. To add to my workload, I am completing the final read-through on a book about surfing and the crazy dog that accompanied me on most of my surfing excursions and mishaps. It is a little like ""On The Road"" by Jack Kerouac, with a cast of nutty characters to give anyone a chuckle. Finally, I started on new book tentatively called the Scion of the Sword, which I have plotted out to the end (which is a joke because books tend to write themselves once the journey begins). 

I love cooking, good restaurants, and Italian cuisine. I am a avid skier, cyclist (mountain and road), hiker and surfer. I paint canvas with oils and sketch on anything. I love Pickwick's Pub where I can raise a Bass, talk to my mates , and enjoy fish and chips without remorse. 

I like the music of Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Likin Park, Leonard Cohen, John Lennon, Verdi, Puccini, Bach's fugues ( the ""Grand Fugue in G Minor"" is a gift to man), Beethoven (Für Elise, and the Ninth Symphony), and Chopin's Nocturnes.

I love travelling to Italy to visit my relatives​ in Abruzzo, and the Marche regions of Italy. The food is amazing. I enjoy cycling in Southwestern France and the Dolomiti mountains in Italy. Contrary to popular opinion, the French are very friendly, and I have a lot of affection for them despite my mothers French Huguenot roots. Her ancestors fled from France to Southampton, England in 1562 fleeing religious persecution as Protestants. Thank God for England. What is ironic is that she is a direct descendant of Isabella of Angouleme, the French Queen Consort of England, and mother of King Henry III of England. Like her ancestral grandmother before her,  she found herself in England rather than her family's ancestral home of France.

My house is located next to 70 miles of trails in Topanga State Park, on a street with almost no neighbors, no traffic, & no noise except for the sound of frogs, our resident peacocks, and an occasional coyote. My house is both cozy and filled with light. The 2000 sq. ft. deck is a spectacular place to have breakfast, spend a day in the Hammock, enjoy the view, or watch the sunset from our hot tub.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />My home is one of a kind. You will be surrounded by nature from the moment you arrive. At night you will fall asleep in a comfortable bed under a goose down duvet while listening to the soothing sounds of crickets, frogs and owls.  In the morning we always have coffee, an assortment of teas, and granola, Muesli, yogurt, berries, bananas, milk and almond milk for breakfast.","My neighborhood is rural and quiet. There are no sidewalks and few cars. Two different entrances to Topanga State Park (the largest enclosed natural park in a city in the world) and hundreds of miles of hiking, biking and horseback riding trails are walking distance from my house.

I grew up between the Mountains of Colorado, in Vail and Aspen, and a large cattle ranch in Northwest Montana.  After a year of school at Prescott College in Arizona and several more shooting ski films in Colorado, I moved to North Hollywood where I lasted about 6 months before fleeing to Half Moon Bay.  I eventually made it back to Hollywood because of ""The Business"" and for about 5 years lived on my sailboat.  Throughout this time I was traveling the world shooting films and first kayak descents of rivers and ski descents of mountains.  About 10 years ago I met my sweetheart at the Premier of an IMAX Film called ""Mystery of the Nile"" we shot while making the first ""Source to Sea"" descent of the Nile.  After a couple of years living in the Marina we decided to settle in Topanga with our young family.  As luck would have it, we found a magical piece of property, with direct access to over 100 miles of hiking/mountain biking trails through Topanga State Park and adjacent wild areas, while being only 22 miles direct from downtown Los Angeles.  Now I am able to work closer to home and family.  Airbnb along with some beautiful property with stunning views is helping fulfill that dream....

I eventually made it back to Hollywood because of ""The Business"" and for about 5 years lived on my sailboat.  Throughout this time I was traveling the world shooting films and first kayak descents of rivers and ski descents of mountains.

I'm a dream enthusiast of both the sleeping and waking types of dreams. In fact, people call me “Doctor Dream.” I’m the bestselling author of seven books including I Had The Strangest Dream, It’s All In Your Dreams, Dreaming Heaven, Dream Oracle Cards, Discover Your Inner Goddess Queen, and Goddess Queen Pearls of Wisdom Journal. 

I began my fascination with dreams at age five with ""tandem dream experiences"" with my younger sister (sharing similar dreams and dreamscapes). Then in my 20s I pursued my then dream career as an actress and, in addition to working with Clint Eastwood, Forest Whittaker, Nicholas Cage, and Anthony Edwards, I was the lead in a B horror film entitled ""Death By Dialogue"" where my character realized if she change her dream (and life script) she could change her life. I didn’t realize then that this would become the premise of my future work (www.DreamLife (Website hidden by Airbnb) 

As a “dream expert” I've had the blessing of revisiting Hollywood, but this time, playing the role of myself, being featured on Doctor Oz, Ricki Lake, The Real, Bethenny, Huffington Post Live, Coast to Coast, and FOX news. 

I also believe that no dream-life is complete without giving back. I’ve been working with inner city kids for nearly a decade, and I find incredible bliss inspiring them to discover a vision of their future and the world that inspires them, take action on it, then pay it forward.

What distinguishes Farideh from other real estate companies is her full real estate service that offers full concierge and a construction development group to build small and large properties from scratch and delivered turn key, as well as worldwide hotel and resort management and advisory services.",,,,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/5e591193-f2a6-4c94-8721-e0665ac87f73.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/5e591193-f2a6-4c94-8721-e0665ac87f73.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Central LA,3.0,3.0,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'google', 'reviews', 'offline_government_id', 'government_id', 'work_email']",t,t,"Beverly Hills, California, United States",Beverly Crest,City of Los Angeles,34.10271,-118.4101,Entire villa,Entire home/apt,12,,13 baths,12.0,12.0,"[""Hangers"", ""Indoor fireplace"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Wifi"", ""Kitchen"", ""Washer"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Pool"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Gym"", ""Free street parking"", ""Dryer"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""TV"", ""Heating"", ""Elevator"", ""Hot tub""]","$5,000.00",30,1125,30.0,30.0,1125.0,1125.0,30.0,1125.0,,t,24,25,55,330,2021-02-09,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,f,3,3,0,0,,POINT (-118.4101 34.10271),1,Beverly Crest L.A.

I’m Matt. I would love to make my home available to you on your travels! I love to travel myself and have been quite a few places. When traveling I prefer to stay at a fellow Airbnb hosts property vs a hotel chain. I have always had a wonderful experience, it makes me feel right at home in a new location, plus, it's a really fun and great way to meet new people.

Born and raised in Hawaii. Attended University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Graduated with a double major in Political Science & History...GO BRUINS! 

I have lived in Bel Air for nearly 15 years. Bel Air is truly an amazing place to call home: all types of food, wine, entertainment, great schools, amazing real estate and centrally located to all LA has to offer. I love live music, animals, outdoor activities, festivals, beach volleyball and more. I love my family & my friends.

While hosting, I have met some really amazing and genuine people from all over the world who have come from all walks of life. Look forward to hosting you.
