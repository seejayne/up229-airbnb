The room was very neat, and having my own bathroom right next to the room was a great plus.  There's lots of space (counter around the sink and top of built-in dresser) in the bathroom to spread out your toiletries.  Bathtub/shower is nice.  My favorite thing was probably the lightning-fast internet!  I wish I had that at home!\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as she says, Janet spent most of her time upstairs when she was home, but I was gone a lot, and she was too.  I wish we had had more time to get to know one another!  I thought it might be a drawback not having a TV in the room, but I was on the go so much, I didn't really miss it!  If you have your laptop, you can watch TV online!\\r\\n\\r\\nStreet parking can be difficult in the evenings, but Janet was very accomodating to work out a system.  All in all, it was a very positive experience!  I definitely look forward to staying with Janet again!</td>\n",

       "      <td>How do I find the words for how effortless, peaceful, and accommodating my stay with Janet was? Well, let me begin at the beginning. I arrive in LA and it is straight to work for me. Fresh off the plane and straight to a days worth of appointments. Night falls and I barely have the energy to grab a bite before entering Janet's place in my GPS. I find the house quite easily in the dark. It is just as she described and thankfully not around some strange corner or up some odd hill which always makes parking in Silverlake such a pain. The approach to the house felt safe and secure, this is a perfect neighborhood. I put the fantastically individually labeled key (this really can be a pain when your trying to unlock a door of a house you don't know in the dark in a neighborhood you don't know) I twist the knob and the door creaks open, only to be answered by the lulling purrs of her cat Bunny. Seeing as how Janet was out of town for the first few days Bunny made sure that I was warmly welcomed into the house. I found my room and hung my clothes on the garment rack which had a generous number of hangars on it. Then straight to bed. The following morning I awoke bathed in beautiful sunlight. The room is sparse but perfectly so in that LA way which made it feel homey yet light. A quick set up of my computer at the great desk and I was on my way, thanks to the easy wifi. The first few days went by quickly as I was so busy with work. Monday rolled around and I knew Janet would be getting home that day. Our meeting was brief, i was coming and she was going but I could feel her warm heart and creative soul right away. That night I had a friend stop by before dinner and funny enough He and Janet knew each other from years past! A small world indeed. On the last day of my trip I parked my car outside of the house so as to make it easy to load up all my bags. Unfamiliar with how adamant the parking enforcement is in LA is I got a parking ticket as it was a street cleaning day. Bummed I walked back into the house to get my last bag and head off. I told Janet about the damned ticket (and how it was only a 15min infraction) and she turned around and insisted she pay for half of it. I refused her generous offer but she just wouldn't have it, she did not want my stay to end on a down note. Scatter-brained I left in a hurry to get on my way and I forgot my last small shopping bag there. Of course Janet went out of her way to mail it to me promptly as that is just...</td>\n",

Flight on time, didn't forget anything, sweet draw on the rental car - I just waltzed right on up to the door of her guest house, ready to flop down on the couch and relax in style.  But it was locked.  And it was raining.  And Late.\\r\\n\\r\\nI swallowed my pride and called Janet.  No answer; probably long asleep.  I went to the back door of the main house and knocked.  Light on, but no answer.  I tried the knob - door's open!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow if I were Janet, home alone, with these night-time shenanigans going on in my downstairs, I'd have one hand on my cellphone and the other tightly gripping my heaviest-gauge cast iron skillet.  Janet, on the other hand, is much more kind and rational.\\r\\n\\r\\nMe:  Hellooo?  Sorry for waking you up, but I can't get in to the guest house.  Am I supposed to be somewhere else?\\r\\n\\r\\nJanet (still half asleep):  Did you get charged $70 for your stay?\\r\\n\\r\\nMe:  Yeah.  I think so.  Did I reserve the downstairs bedroom?\\r\\n\\r\\nJanet:  Yes, you did.  Down the hall.  The key is on the table, you've got your own bathroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nFast forward to night 2 ---&gt;  I get home late from work.  There's no parking anywhere.  The REAL guest house guests blocked anyone else from the driveway.  So I double park behind Janet.  Of course I leave a note, describing my ordeal and when I need to leave for work in the morning.... but I'm already on thin ground.  Next morning, Janet, while running a bit late herself, coolly knocks on my door to do a vehicle presto-changeo.  No fuss, no drama.\\r\\n\\r\\nTL; DR:  Janet is the BOSS when it comes to dealing with guests and their travel hiccups.  Every stay with her, in any guest room she offers, is comfortable, relaxing, and full of the best hospitality any AirBnB host can hope to offer!</td>\n",

       "      <td>Yamileth place was great and affordable!\\nVery easy to check in \\nGreat parking for one vehicle \\n\\n\\nEverything was great my only thing was there was a lot of hair in the room and common area , there was plenty of cleaning supplies to do a quick touch up real quick . If you’re anything of a clean freak you’ll spot small things other than that the stay is great .\\n\\nI loved the kitchen , the refrigerator was great even has crushed ice which is my favorite lol , we didn’t think we needed our blender for our thanksgiving dinner to blend our spices but we very much had to go buy one so if you’re going to blend something bring yours from home . There was pots and pans , coffee , some spices , oil , I can’t think of the remaining of the cooking supplies but there was a variety .\\n\\nThere are other people that live there but you indeed have privacy , the guy’s tv was pretty loud all night I saw the guys review and thought he was joking but it’s true loud tv you can hear it through the drywall . Very nice people there though , the pool is great for a quick relaxed moment. \\n\\nOverall it was a great experience .</td>\n",

Since this was my first experience with airbnb, I really lucked out!  The room was very neat, and having my own bathroom right next to the room was a great plus.  There's lots of space (counter around the sink and top of built-in dresser) in the bathroom to spread out your toiletries.  Bathtub/shower is nice.  My favorite thing was probably the lightning-fast internet!  I wish I had that at home!\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as she says, Janet spent most of her time upstairs when she was home, but I was gone a lot, and she was too.  I wish we had had more time to get to know one another!  I thought it might be a drawback not having a TV in the room, but I was on the go so much, I didn't really miss it!  If you have your laptop, you can watch TV online!\\r\\n\\r\\nStreet parking can be difficult in the evenings, but Janet was very accomodating to work out a system.  All in all, it was a very positive experience!  I definitely look forward to staying with Janet again!   \n",

Easy parking. Driveway not as steep as I was told, easy pezy. Warm and toasty for cold nights in LA (Central heat) and cool by day Easterly views/sun in AM mostly. Totally recommend it.    \n",

Lovely home, lovely room.\\r\\nShe is super friendly and I've got to know her friend Janet (same name, yes), who works with holistic energy. It was a pleasure being with you girls!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy only problem was about parking. I've rented a car and had to park it on the street. But everyday after 6pm It was so crowded I had to park it far away from the house.    \n",
       "26     How do I find the words for how effortless, peaceful, and accommodating my stay with Janet was? Well, let me begin at the beginning. I arrive in LA and it is straight to work for me. Fresh off the plane and straight to a days worth of appointments. Night falls and I barely have the energy to grab a bite before entering Janet's place in my GPS. I find the house quite easily in the dark. It is just as she described and thankfully not around some strange corner or up some odd hill which always makes parking in Silverlake such a pain. The approach to the house felt safe and secure, this is a perfect neighborhood. I put the fantastically individually labeled key (this really can be a pain when your trying to unlock a door of a house you don't know in the dark in a neighborhood you don't know) I twist the knob and the door creaks open, only to be answered by the lulling purrs of her cat Bunny. Seeing as how Janet was out of town for the first few days Bunny made sure that I was warmly welcomed into the house. I found my room and hung my clothes on the garment rack which had a generous number of hangars on it. Then straight to bed. The following morning I awoke bathed in beautiful sunlight. The room is sparse but perfectly so in that LA way which made it feel homey yet light. A quick set up of my computer at the great desk and I was on my way, thanks to the easy wifi. The first few days went by quickly as I was so busy with work. Monday rolled around and I knew Janet would be getting home that day. Our meeting was brief, i was coming and she was going but I could feel her warm heart and creative soul right away. That night I had a friend stop by before dinner and funny enough He and Janet knew each other from years past! A small world indeed. On the last day of my trip I parked my car outside of the house so as to make it easy to load up all my bags. Unfamiliar with how adamant the parking enforcement is in LA is I got a parking ticket as it was a street cleaning day. Bummed I walked back into the house to get my last bag and head off. I told Janet about the damned ticket (and how it was only a 15min infraction) and she turned around and insisted she pay for half of it. I refused her generous offer but she just wouldn't have it, she did not want my stay to end on a down note. Scatter-brained I left in a hurry to get on my way and I forgot my last small shopping bag there. Of course Janet went out of her way to mail it to me promptly as that is just...   \n",

I was feeling smug.  Flight on time, didn't forget anything, sweet draw on the rental car - I just waltzed right on up to the door of her guest house, ready to flop down on the couch and relax in style.  But it was locked.  And it was raining.  And Late.\\r\\n\\r\\nI swallowed my pride and called Janet.  No answer; probably long asleep.  I went to the back door of the main house and knocked.  Light on, but no answer.  I tried the knob - door's open!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow if I were Janet, home alone, with these night-time shenanigans going on in my downstairs, I'd have one hand on my cellphone and the other tightly gripping my heaviest-gauge cast iron skillet.  Janet, on the other hand, is much more kind and rational.\\r\\n\\r\\nMe:  Hellooo?  Sorry for waking you up, but I can't get in to the guest house.  Am I supposed to be somewhere else?\\r\\n\\r\\nJanet (still half asleep):  Did you get charged $70 for your stay?\\r\\n\\r\\nMe:  Yeah.  I think so.  Did I reserve the downstairs bedroom?\\r\\n\\r\\nJanet:  Yes, you did.  Down the hall.  The key is on the table, you've got your own bathroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nFast forward to night 2 --->  I get home late from work.  There's no parking anywhere.  The REAL guest house guests blocked anyone else from the driveway.  So I double park behind Janet.  Of course I leave a note, describing my ordeal and when I need to leave for work in the morning.... but I'm already on thin ground.  Next morning, Janet, while running a bit late herself, coolly knocks on my door to do a vehicle presto-changeo.  No fuss, no drama.\\r\\n\\r\\nTL; DR:  Janet is the BOSS when it comes to dealing with guests and their travel hiccups.  Every stay with her, in any guest room she offers, is comfortable, relaxing, and full of the best hospitality any AirBnB host can hope to offer!   \n",

If you’re anything of a clean freak you’ll spot small things other than that the stay is great .\\n\\nI loved the kitchen , the refrigerator was great even has crushed ice which is my favorite lol , we didn’t think we needed our blender for our thanksgiving dinner to blend our spices but we very much had to go buy one so if you’re going to blend something bring yours from home . There was pots and pans , coffee , some spices , oil , I can’t think of the remaining of the cooking supplies but there was a variety .\\n\\nThere are other people that live there but you indeed have privacy , the guy’s tv was pretty loud all night I saw the guys review and thought he was joking but it’s true loud tv you can hear it through the drywall . Very nice people there though , the pool is great for a quick relaxed moment. \\n\\nOverall it was a great experience .   \n",

Air circulation is non-existent - only one window. \\nTHE PARKING:  Expect neighbor to park in your spot intermittently.  Hosts suggests you place \"No Parking\" sign (doozy)\\nTHE TEMPERATURE:  Hot!!   AC/Humidifier lacks exhaust duct so if you bother using it to cool, the heat from the exhaust actually ends up warming up the unit. It also leaks due to missing tube.  Pointless.   \n",
