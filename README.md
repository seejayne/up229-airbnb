# up229-airbnb
Repo for UP229 group project looking at Los Angeles Airbnb data from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html

Our notebooks are broken down into various steps, numbered to try and give a sense of the sequential order although some were paralell tasks.  

Note: Some of the csv files used and generated in our project are very large and we could not upload them to our github 'data' file. Instead, you see the files [here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OXy6-31V2H3e6OfQoCz4PS_OrbChd4uH?usp=sharing)
